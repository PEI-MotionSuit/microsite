However, not all mockups were finalized, as only a few were required at this stage to support ongoing development. The remaining mockups will be created in future sprints as the design evolves and additional features are defined. Deciding which technologies to use was also delayed due to limited time and the need to prioritize other critical development tasks. Moving forward, the team plans to dedicate more time to technologies and design updates in upcoming sprints to ensure all project materials remain complete and aligned with progress."}]}}')}}]);
