# State of the Art

Posture monitoring and its correction turned into a market that is rapidly evolving due to the advances in sensor technology and data analytics. The principal competitors in this area typically integrate sensor technology to capture body posture, detect anomalies and provide real-time feedback for users.

Some products are more focused on athletic performance and rehabilitation, offering movement tracking combined with personalized corrective exercise plans. At the end of each session, users can usually access a report, helping users to prevent injuries and improve mobility through the exercises recommended.

Other projects are specialized in workplace safety by analyzing physical effort and risk behaviors throughout the day. This can be done due to wearable sensors placed on key body segments, like the spine and shoulders, which help to identify ergonomic issues.

There also exist other solutions that rely on photo/video analysis to deliver posture assessments, offering daily exercises and continuous feedback.

Overall, while many competitors offer specialized focus areas, like sports or posture correction, the most innovative systems combine multisensor data aggregation and user-friendly analytics to transform how users monitor and improve their posture health.
