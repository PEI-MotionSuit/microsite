        **Paulo Martins** is a 36-year-old factory line operator with 13 years of hands-on experience on the production floor. He knows the job inside out and is valued for his reliability and practical skills, but years of repetitive tasks have left him with nagging aches and occasional flare-ups. Paulo is not up to date with current technology and feels uneasy about gadgets and apps, he prefers straightforward, easy-to-use solutions that do not disrupt his routine. At work he follows established procedures and values clear, practical guidance, however, he worries that an unnoticed injury or a worsening condition could force him out of the job he’s done his whole life.

> **_Motivation:_** Paulo wants to avoid injury or the worsening of existing physical problems so he can remain active at work and postpone retirement, maintaining his independence and income for as long as possible.

> **_Use case:_** Paulo uses the MotionSuit during his daily shifts to monitor his posture while performing repetitive assembly tasks. The system tracks his movements and alerts him in real time when he adopts a harmful position, helping him prevent the worsening of chronic pain caused by decades of physical labor.

> **_Scenario:_** Paulo arrives at the factory early in the morning and puts on the MotionSuit before starting his shift. As he works on the production line, the suit quietly monitors his body movements. After a few hours, he receives a gentle vibration alert indicating that he has been bending his back incorrectly while handling materials. He adjusts his stance, and the alert stops. At the end of the day, he checks the dashboard and notices a summary showing fewer posture warnings than the day before, giving him confidence that he’s improving and protecting his health.

        **Manuel Ferreira** is a 58-year-old construction worker with 40 years of experience in the field. His job demands physical strength, endurance, and constant movement, often involving heavy lifting and awkward postures. Over the years, these repetitive tasks have taken a toll on his body, causing occasional pain and minor injuries. Although Manuel is familiar with basic technology, he doesn’t rely on it much at work and prefers practical tools that genuinely help him in his daily routine. He understands the physical strain of his profession and recognizes the importance of taking care of his body to continue performing effectively.

> **_Motivation:_** Manuel wants to prevent new injuries and stop existing physical problems from getting worse due to the physically demanding nature of his work.

> **_Use Case:_** Manuel wears the MotionSuit on construction sites to track heavy lifting movements and detect poor posture or excessive strain. The system warns him when his actions may cause potential injury and helps him maintain safe working habits over time.

> **_Scenario:_** While lifting concrete blocks at a building site, Manuel receives an alert from the MotionSuit indicating that he is twisting his torso while carrying weight. He immediately corrects his posture and repositions his feet. Later, during his break, he checks the mobile dashboard, which shows the specific moments when his posture was risky. The clear and visual feedback helps him understand how to lift more safely, preventing strain and reducing his fatigue throughout the week.

        **Matilde Rodrigue** is a 20-year-old DETI university student who has been pursuing her studies for the past three years. She spends most of her days attending lectures, working on projects, and studying for long hours, often sitting in front of a computer. While she is comfortable with modern technology and uses it daily for academic purposes, she doesn’t always pay attention to her posture during study sessions. Over time, this habit has led to occasional back and neck discomfort, especially after long periods of concentration.
    </div>
</div>

> **_Motivation:_** Matilde wants to improve her posture to feel more comfortable while studying and to prevent potential physical problems that could develop in the future due to prolonged sitting.

> **_Use Case:_** Matilde uses the MotionSuit while studying to monitor her posture during long sessions at her desk. The system provides real-time alerts when she slouches or sits incorrectly, encouraging her to maintain a healthy and comfortable position.

> **_Scenario:_** After several hours of studying for an exam, Matilde begins to slouch over her laptop without realizing it. The MotionSuit sends her a soft vibration alert, reminding her to straighten her back. She adjusts her posture and continues studying more comfortably. At the end of the week, she reviews the dashboard, which shows a clear decrease in posture alerts. She feels proud that the system helps her prevent potential long-term back issues while improving her concentration and comfort.

        **Joana Almeida** is a 24-year-old researcher who has been working in her field for the past three years. With a strong academic background and curiosity about human behavior and biomechanics, she focuses her work on studying how people move and interact in different environments. Joana is familiar with current technology and often uses digital tools and data analysis software in her research. Her work involves collecting, processing, and interpreting data related to human posture and movement to better understand how these factors influence physical well-being and performance.

        > **_Motivation:_** Joana aims to collect and analyze information about human movements in different contexts and conditions to monitor posture, identify movement patterns, and detect potential risk factors that could lead to physical issues.

> **_Motivation:_** Joana aims to collect and analyze information about human movements in different contexts and conditions to monitor posture, identify movement patterns, and detect potential risk factors that could lead to physical issues.

> **_Use Case:_** Joana uses the MotionSuit in her research to collect data on human posture and movement in different conditions. She analyzes the information to identify patterns, evaluate ergonomics, and detect risk factors associated with physical strain.

> **_Scenario:_** Joana sets up an experiment in a laboratory where participants wear the MotionSuit while performing various tasks. The sensors capture motion data, which is automatically uploaded to the dashboard. She observes that participants performing repetitive bending movements exhibit specific posture deviations. Using the collected metrics, Joana prepares a detailed report correlating poor posture frequency with muscle fatigue levels. The MotionSuit helps her conduct precise, data-driven analysis to support her research conclusions.
