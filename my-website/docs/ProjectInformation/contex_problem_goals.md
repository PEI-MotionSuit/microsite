# Context and Main Goals

## The context and specifications of the project
Modern lifestyles and working environments often involve prolonged periods of sitting or repetitive movements, which can lead to poor posture and, consequently, muscular and skeletal pain or injuries. 

Despite growing awareness of the importance of ergonomics, there is still a lack of practical and continuous solutions capable of monitoring human posture in real time. 

This project aims to address this issue through the development of a **wearable suit equipped with sensors** that detect and record body movements in real time.

The collected data will be processed into meaningful metrics and presented through an intuitive dashboard, enabling users to monitor their posture and receive alerts about improper positioning.

## Goals of the project

1. Advanced technology integration
2. Specialized Access Management
3. Strengthening safety and health
4. Data analysis and reports
5. Reduce ergonomic risks
